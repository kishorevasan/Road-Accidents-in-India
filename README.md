# Road-Accidents-in-India
A data visualization project on Road Accidents in India in 2014. Includes an animation of accident count throughout India split in a 24h window.

The data set was provided by Indian Government and can be viewed at [Link](https://data.gov.in/catalog/stateut-wise-traffic-accidents-time-occurrence)

There is a common conception that most road accidents happen during the night due to drinking and driving, but the reality is that this statement is only partially true. This project uses data visualization to help people realize that most accidents happen during the day, which can be easily avoided. We must look closer into data and not scrape through it concluding that most accidents happen at night and can't be avoided.
